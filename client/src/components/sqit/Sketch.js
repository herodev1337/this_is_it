/**
 * Main SQIT Component.
 * 
 * It's one big div that contains 2 divs holding a canvas element and 2 aceditor instances. 
 * The aceeditor instances are splitted into the main editor for text input and an output editor 
 * which is right under the main editor.
 * 
 * At the start we get the corrosponding sketch and initial text1/2.
 * After that we get a react reference which will go into our p5 parent div 
 * (the div which will hold the p5 canvas element later).
 * We also get 2 react states. They will represent the 2 texts that will go into the AceEditor instances.
 * 
 * We also create a new state that will hold the p5 instance 
 * and a function that will be called by the first ace editor instance.
 * 
 * In the useEffect hook we'll get our p5 instance and our text getter.
 * We also register some event listeners which will resize the canvas on resize events.
 * If a customResize property exists on the p5 instance we will also call that. 
 * It represents some custom resize functionality if needed.
 * 
 * The returned component calls the <Editor> which in fact creates 2 ace editor instances 
 * which will get the text1/2 state as value.
 * It also creates a div which will get our p5Ref and will hold the canvas element in the future.
 * If the setText1/2 gets used in the future it will update these components.
 * The getter gets called when the onChange event on the main ace editor gets fired 
 * (eg. if you type anything in the editor). 
 * It will receive the whole text of the editor in one string and we have to process it in the corrosponding config.
